Packet Flagon Automation
===============

These cookbooks and roles are used by the actual PacketFlagon.is platform to automate and manage the infrastructure.

Certain elements such as Environment attributes and data bags might not exist in this open code but should be easy enough to work out from the Recipies.

Getting Started
-------------------------
The easiest way to get started is to clone this repo and then move the Cookbooks you need and adjust your existing roles to use the recipes as required.

Most PacketFlagon servers either use the packetflagon_squid or packetflagon_frontend role.
